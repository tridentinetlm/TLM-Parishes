# TLM-Parishes
Divi Child Theme for Traditional Latin Mass Parishes
<hr>
### This is the public repository for the Divi Child themes that are used to build the individual parish websites as a part of the Tridentine TLM website network.  This WordPress Multisite network is hosted and maintained at no charge to the individual parish.  The Catholic parish need only to host a Tridentine Mass, and maintain a Tradtional Latin Mass community.

If you are a TLM parishioner, and you desire to promote the Tradtional Latin Mass, please join our team.  You will be paid for code work, and writing content.

Please view my bio and feel free to send me an email.

Thank you!

Deo Gratias!
